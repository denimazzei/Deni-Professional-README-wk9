Brainstorming / Pseudocode for Week 9 Homework: Professional README Generator
TASK : Initialize project
create index.js
run npm init
run npm i inquirer

TASK : Create new repo with .gitignore file and include node_modules/ and .DS.Store/ 

PSEUDO-CODE:
const fs = require('fs');
const inquirer = require('inquirer');
  (Learn to use Inquirer Node package/API)
Prompt user: Just use inquirer's .prompt() method
Create prompts
 Prompts:
What is your name?
Where are you from?
What is your favorite hobby?
What is your favorite food?
Enter your GitHub Username:
Enter your LinkedIn URL:
What do we pass into the .prompt() method?
Uses an array of objects that look like:
{
	type: ..., (probably just "input" for the most part)
	message: ..., (this is the actual prompt displayed to the user)
	name: ... (this can be anything we want... is used as the property name on the response object to retrieve the value that the user typed.)
}
Uses Promise .then(callbackFunction...);
inquirer.prompt([{...}, {...},...]).then(response => {...});
Maybe console.log successfully
Create the HTML and incorporate user responses (from response object)
probably using Template Literal syntax to build the HTML
Write/output HTML file to the application root director (same folder that contains the .js)
use the fs.writeFile(fileName, htmlString, (err) => {...}) method
Need to write out Success message after successfully outputing HTML
inside writeFile callback, verify that there was no error.
Just use console.log() for this
